/**
 * Demo how to use public Node class.
 * Use the public Node class to do the following:
 *    create standalone Node objects,
 *    connect Node objects to form a single linked list,
 *    do something with nodes in the single linked list,
 *    add new Node to first/last location, 
 *    remove the first or last Node,
 *    traverse the entire single linked list
 * Code not in textbook.
